### Module Title: Bridging AI and Earth Observation (AI+EO)

### Module Description:

In this educational module, we will delve into the exciting intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Earth Observation (EO). AI and EO are two powerful technologies that, when combined, have the potential to transform our understanding of our planet, drive innovation, and address critical global challenges.

### Recommended Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of AI concepts and some familiarity with Earth Observation data would be beneficial but not mandatory.

### Module Objectives:

1. Introduction to AI and EO: Begin with an overview of the intersection of AI and EO, explaining their individual significance and how they complement each other.
2. Use Cases: Explore real-world use cases where AI and EO have been successfully applied in the domains of energy, agriculture, health, and energy.
3. AI Tools and Services for EO: Explore various AI techniques, including machine learning and deep learning, and how they are applied to EO data for analysis and interpretation.
4. Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical considerations and challenges related to AI and EO, including privacy and data security.
